# Zettelkasten

Uses [neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/) to run the zettelkasten. 
Currently I mainly use it for daily journaling. 

# Install

The setup is based on the [neuron install instructions for
docker](https://neuron.zettel.page/docker).

If you have docker installed you can simply run:

```
make run
```

To start the neuron container.


# Usage

Added a shortcut to add a new journal entry:

```
make diary
```

Will open a markdown file with todays date with vim.
